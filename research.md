## Research

### Current Research Work

My current research projects involve utilizing advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models and natural language processing to design powerful therapeutic antibody candidates. Some of my current projects include:
* A diffusion model that jointly diffuses antibody sequence identity, residue coordinates, and residue orientations for applications in antibody design
* A comparison of protein design performance with state space models, GPT-style transformers, and linear complexity transformers
* A benchmark of the ability of large protein language models at capturing the biophysical properties of therapeutic antibodies
