### Current Research Projects

My ongoing research focuses on leveraging advancements in `denoising diffusion probabilistic models` and `large language models` to develop highly effective `therapeutic antibody candidates`. Here are a few of the projects I am currently working on:
* Development of a `diffusion model` that jointly diffuses antibody sequence identity, residue coordinate, and residue orientation for applications in antibody design
* Comparitive analysis of protein design performance using `state space models`, `GPT-style transformers`, and `linear complexity transformers`
* Creation of a benchmark to asses the ability of `large protein language models` in capturing the biophysical properties of therapeutic antibodies
