Hello! I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University using machine learning to better understand and harness the language of proteins.

Here's some more info [about me](about.md), details about [my current research projects](research.md), and [my resume](resume.md).

For the curious reader... the figure above shows the binding of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody MW07 to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (PDB 7DK2). I re-designed the antibody's complementarity determining region (CDR) loops using an antibody-specific diffusion model, and the resulting re-designed antibody exhibits enhanced therapeutic qualities.
