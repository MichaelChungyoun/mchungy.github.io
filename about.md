---

I am a 3rd year joint PhD student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and Master's student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University in the [**Jeffrey Gray Lab Group**](https://graylab.jhu.edu/), developing deep learning models for antibody folding and therapeutic design. My degree is funded entirely through the [**NSF Graduate Research Fellowship**](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [**Graduate Education for Minorities Fellowship**](https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/).

I have industry internship experience at Prescient Design, Genentech, Novo Nordisk, Adaptive Biotechnologies, and Membrion. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, where I conducted 4 years of undergraduate research across the [**Elizabeth Nance Lab Group**](https://www.nancelab.com/) and Chris Hague Lab Group.
