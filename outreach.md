title: Outreach
---

I have felt empowered and fulfilled by conducting research, and I have aimed to create such opportunities and experiences for younger scientists as well. While at Johns Hopkins, I continue to develop outreach events in the surrounding Baltimore area for K â€“ 12 schools. In 2022 I co-founded the `Hopkins Artificial Intelligence K-12 Education Program (HAIKU)`, with financial support from the `Johns Hopkins School of Engineering` and `InventXYZ`, a tech education company. The Johns Hopkins students within HAIKU develop 3 - 6 week education modules targeted to K-12 students, in topics ranging from computer vision applied to interpreting sign language, to generating novel artwork using text-to-image diffusion-based generative deep learning models.
